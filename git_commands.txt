If you have made local changes that you haven't pushed, and you want to pull down my latest changes:

    $ git pull --rebase --autostash # automatically stashes your changes, pulls, then applies your stashed changes locally

Or you can do the same thing with separate individual commands:

    $ git stash # tucks your changes aside
    $ git pull # pulls down my changes
    $ git stash pop # re-applies your changes to the version with my changes

If there are no conflicts, this just works. If there are conflicts, those conflicts will stay in your git stash. To view them:

    $ git stash list
